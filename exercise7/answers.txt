Question 1 - AWS EC2

Answer:
Port Scans of Amazon EC2 instances are generally ineffective because, by default,
all inbound ports on EC2 instances are closed and have to be opened by the customer.
By using security groups the customer can further mitigate the thread of port scanning [1].
Each security group has a set of rules that specify that allow traffic from associated
instances or from external sources [2].
If a customer allows traffic from any source to a specific port, that port will be vulnerable
to a port scan and the user has to use appropriate security measures to protect listening
services [1].

Question 3 - AWS S3

Answer:
Bucket access control is configured using Amazon S3 subressources through the API.
There are a number of subressources(location, access control list, cors ,etc)
that can be configured [4].
In particular, bucket policies give users the right to access a bucket for reading/writing.
Only the bucket owner is allowed to associate a policy with a bucket. For controlling access
, there are specific Amazon S3 operations, such as GetObject, GetObjectVersion, DeleteObject
or DeleteBucket[5].

Question 4 - AWS SES

Answer:
Before sending Email with Amazon SES, it is necessary to verify that the email-
adress or domain is actually owned with Amazon SES. For each region this must be
done separately. To set up DKIM, there is a procedure for Amazon SES called Easy DKIM
It involves using the Amazon SES console or API to generate TXT files and then adding
the records in those files to the DNS settings. After receiving a confirmation
email from AWS it is then possible to send Emails signed with a DKIM signature from
any valid adress in the verified domain.

Question 5 - AWS EMR

Answer:

The security settings of the cluster can be set using Identity and Access Management
policies(IAM). IAM is a web service to create policies and attach them to principals,
such as users and groups. This will allows and deny user permissions. By default,
the cluster is visible to all IAM Users of that AWS account! If they have the proper policy permissions, they can also manage it.

Also, on first boot, by default, Amazon Linux AMIs connect to package repositories to install security updates before other services start.
